LED stands for light emitting diode. LED lighting products produce light up to 90% more efficiently than incandescent light bulbs. The high efficiency and directional nature of LEDs makes them ideal for many industrial uses.

A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current flows through it. When current passes through an LED, the electrons recombine with holes emitting light in the process.

The material used most often in LEDs is gallium arsenide, though there are many variations on this basic compound, such as aluminum gallium arsenide or aluminum gallium indium phosphide

LED bulbs don't burn out like regular bulbs, which simply stop working abruptly when they run out of power. Instead, LED bulbs slowly degrade over time.


Component List

To make this adjustable led light circuit, we might need some electronics component.

All components list have been given below –


Component List – 

•	Transistor – BC 547

•	Resistor - 220 Ω, 1K Ω, 2.2K Ω, 1 M Ω, 4.7K Ω *2 

•	Capacitor - 47µf/ 25v*3

•	LED – 6 Pieces (5mm)

•	Volume – B 100K

•	Power Source – DC 12v


Transistor Pinout

We everybody knows that, all kind of transistor contain 3 legs. And all 3 legs have 3 different names. To make this amplifier circuit connection, 1st we need to know about the pin out of this transistor

BC 547 – BC 547 is an NPN transistor. If we count it’s leg from left side, then 1st leg “Collector” 2nd leg “Base” and 3rd leg “Emitter”



Feature of BC-547

•	The gain of DC current (hFE) = 800 A.

•	Continuous Ic (collector current) = 100mA.

•	VBE (emitter-base voltage) = 6V.

•	IB (base current) = 5mA.

•	The polarity of the transistor is NPN.

•	The transition frequency is 300MHz.

•	It is obtainable in semiconductor package like-92.



Advantages of LED Lighting

•	Long Lifespan.

•	Energy Efficiency.

•	Improved Environmental Performance.

•	The Ability to Operate in Cold Conditions.

•	No Heat or UV Emissions.

•	Design Flexibility.

•	Instant Lighting and the Ability to Withstand Frequent Switching.

•	Low Voltage Operation.

Hardware of SMT Project Circuit


To make this mini power amplifier circuit, we might need some electronics component. JLCPCB has its own parts library. JLCPCB has 200k+ in stock components, 24 hours rapid SMT assembly. You can check SMT parts library here - https://jlcpcb.com/parts



Circuit Connection – Step 1

To make this circuit, we are using 6 pieces led light. 1st we divide this led light by 2, than each side there will be 3 pieces led light. Now we make a series connection in these 3 pieces led light.
Now we connect 1 side led light negative leg with emitter leg of transistor.

Then we make a series connection between 4.7KΩ resistor. At this time, we connect this two resistor with positive leg of two side LED light. Then connect, 4.7KΩ resistor series point with “Collector” leg of transistor.


Circuit Connection – Step 2

Again we need to make a series connection, between 2.2 KΩ resistor and 1 MΩ resistor. Then connect one side of 2.2 KΩ resistor with Collector leg of transistor resistor and 1 MΩ with Base of transistor.

Now we connect, resistor series section with negative leg of other side led light.


Circuit Connection – Step 3

This time, we need to make series connection with these 3 capacitors. That means, we connect one capacitor negative leg with other capacitor positive leg, and this method continue for all capacitors.

For this way, from here we will get two terminal. One is positive and the other one is negative. We connect capacitor positive terminal with Collector leg of transistor and connect negative leg with Base leg of transistor.


Circuit Connection – Step 4

This time, we connect led positive leg with DC-12v power supply and connect DC 12-v negative cable with Emitter leg of transistor.

To adjust volume, now we need to connect a potentiometer with the circuit. We connect potentiometer input cable with 220 Ω resistor and the resistor other terminal with positive and negative terminal of capacitor.

Then we connect, potentiometer output leg with Emitter leg of transistor.

Circuit Connection – Step 5

Now we just need to connect a 1KΩ resistor with the circuit. We connect this resistor with DC-12v negative leg and other terminal with capacitor positive and negative leg.

Our circuit is now completely ready for use. Just plug-in power, rotate potentiometer smoothly and enjoy the circuit.

Thanks to JLCPCB for offering us, this SMT PCB circuit.


Soldering And Cleaning

Neat and perfect soldering is an important part of all kind of PCBs. Since soldering, you should remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit. After soldering all leg, 

we cut-off the extra leg of all electronics component.
